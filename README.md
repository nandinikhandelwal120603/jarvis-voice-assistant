## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
    cd jarvis-voice-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the AI Engine**
    Open `src/hooks/useVoiceAssistant.js` and replace the `WEBHOOK_URL` placeholder with your n8n (or similar) webhook URL:
    ```javascript
    const WEBHOOK_URL = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE';
    ```

4.  **Run Locally**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🎮 How to Use

1.  **Grant Microphone Permissions**: Ensure your browser allows microphone access for the site.
2.  **Activate**: Click the central **Orb** to start listening.
3.  **Command**: Speak your prompt clearly. The Orb will turn **green** while listening and **orange** while processing.
4.  **Respond**: Jarvis will respond with text subtitles and vocal feedback (the Orb will turn **cyan** while speaking).

## 🧩 n8n Integration (Recommended)

This assistant is designed to work perfectly with an n8n workflow. A typical setup includes:
-   **Webhook Node**: Receives the `message` and `sessionId`.
-   **AI Agent Node**: Process the input using Gemini, OpenAI, or Claude.
-   **Response Node**: Returns a JSON object in the format `{"reply": "Your response here"}`.
